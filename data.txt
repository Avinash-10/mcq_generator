OpenAI is a U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015, researching artificial intelligence with the declared
intention of developing "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform 
humans at most economically valuable work". As one of the leading organizations of the AI Spring,it has developed several large 
language models, advanced image generation models, and previously, also open-source models.Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with
starting the artificial intelligence spring.

The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. registered in Delaware and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC.It was
founded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela
Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members.Microsoft provided OpenAI Global
LLC with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023,[17][18] with a significant portion of the investment in the form
of compute resources on Microsoft's Azure cloud service.

On November 17, 2023, the board removed Altman as CEO, while Brockman was removed as chairman and then resigned as president. Four days later,
both returned after negotiations with the board, and most of the board members resigned. The new initial board included former Salesforce co-CEO
Bret Taylor as chairman and Microsoft with a non-voting board seat.
