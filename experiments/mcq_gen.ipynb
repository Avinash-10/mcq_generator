As one of the leading organizations of the AI Spring,it has developed several large \\nlanguage models, advanced image generation models, and previously, also open-source models.Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with\\nstarting the artificial intelligence spring.\\n\\nThe organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. registered in Delaware and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC.It was\\nfounded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela\\nVagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members.Microsoft provided OpenAI Global\\nLLC with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023,[17][18] with a significant portion of the investment in the form\\nof compute resources on Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud service.\\n\\nOn November 17, 2023, the board removed Altman as CEO, while Brockman was removed as chairman and then resigned as president. Four days later,\\nboth returned after negotiations with the board, and most of the board members resigned. The new initial board included former Salesforce co-CEO\\nBret Taylor as chairman and Microsoft with a non-voting board seat.',\n",
